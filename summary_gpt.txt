Your DNA is 60 similar to a bananas DNA. This is true because humans and bananas have the same ancestor if you go far back in time. 3.7 billion years ago, there was a single common ancestor of all living organisms on Earth. The name LUCA stands for Last Universal Common Ancestor.  LUCA wasnt the first living organism on Earth. There must have been other living organisms before it. This raises the question how did LUCA come to life? Was there a divine force that breathed life into it? Or was it an alien that came to live on earth? This questions the origin of life. In the 1780s, a French chemist, Antoine Lavoisier conducted the first experiment which proved that perhaps living things arent that different from nonliving things. He observed how fast the ice melted using this animals body heat. Then he compared these findings with a piece of coal which released the same amount of carbon dioxide and melted the same way. Italian doctor, Luigi Galvani, was working on some dead frogs. He had the frogs legs hooked on a brass hook and he was holding a steel blade. The blade brushed by the legs by mistake, and the legs started shaking. After seeing this, he concluded that life is a chemical process. But his conclusion was proven wrong by Alessandro Volta. Most of the chemical compounds found in a living being, like fats, proteins, and sugars, werent found in any nonliving thing. Thats why scientists named these Organic Compounds. And scientists believed that these organic compounds since they are found only in living things, there must be some sort of a life force creating them. In 1828, German chemist Friedrich Whler accidentally created an organic compound from an inorganic compound. Since this point, the concept of life force started losing credibility. In the 1850s, a chemist living in Paris, Marcellin Berthelot, began a total synthesis program. He said that using only carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen he could create all organic compounds. And he did. In 2011, biophysicist Edward Trifonov tried to look for the definitions of life. He found 123 different definitions. There was a common consensus among all these definitions. But instead of simplifying things, we need to understand the differences. Living beings are made up of numerous chemical compounds. Nonliving things arent as complex. The second difference is Metabolism. Every living thing needs food to get energy. The third difference is the Boundary. The living organisms are separated from their surrounding environment through a boundary. The transition from nonliving to living did not happen suddenly. It was slow and gradual, like a spectrum. Even the smallest singlecelled microbes can replicate themselves. The DNA in them can replicate to create more of them. And the fourth condition is Reproduction. Some scientists believe that the building blocks of our life came from these comets and meteors. According to this, life did not begin on Earth, it began in space. We know this because of Spectroscopy. The spectrum of light emitted by stars and galaxies millions of miles away, is analysed to figure out its chemical composition. Using data science, we can figure out in detail which elements are present. Scalar has placement partnerships with more than 900 companies including Google, Meta, Flipkart, Amazon, and Myntra.

In 1969, in Australia, in the Murchison meteorite, more than 20 amino acids were found. After that, scientists discovered urea, glycine, and ethanol in space. Sagittarius B2 cloud, which is 25,000 light years away from Earth, was found to have molecules that showed Chirality. The core component of DNA and RNA is a sugar called Ribose. 25,000 light years away, in a gas cloud like Sagittarius B2, we found sugar glycolaldehyde. This means that the building blocks of the building block like DNA andRNA are already found in space. Our solar system, meteors, and comets must have lent these complex molecules. In 1871, Charles Darwin said that in a small hot pond, that had ammonia, phosphates, electricity, light, and heat some sort of a protein must have been created first. And later, that protein would have evolved into Life. But is it truly possible? A practical experiment was conducted in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey. They introduced sparks of electricity into the container similar to the conditions on Earth 4 billion years ago. Clay provides a surface on which the organic molecules can collect they keep getting concentrated. Charged surfaces of clay help in binding together the primary organic molecules and in speeding up the reactions between them. This experiment proved that with the right conditions and raw materials, the building blocks of life will start forming on their own. It is still a big mystery how did the first RNA molecule form by itself and how did it start to selfreplicate. But there have been practical experiments to better understand this. Here, we come to the RNA World Hypothesis, according to which RNA evolved first, after that proteins were formed, and then DNA. The soap molecules stick to the dirt and dust on your hands and together they get washed away. Why does this happen? Because its the property of fatty acids. In the water, lipids started forming small bubbles. Chemicals were trapped inside these bubbles. And these lipids evolved into primitive cell membranes. Protocells refer to the cells that existed before the cells we know today. These were the simplest forms of cells and these protocells later evolved into cells when they became more complex. Metabolism. How did metabolism begin? What was the need to consume something? The simple answer is to get energy. If RNA and DNA had to replicate themselves, they needed energy.  LUCA must have been born somewhere around these vents. To survive, the protocells needed energy so they began trapping the nutrients from this water inside themselves. And the nutrients they needed to create amino acids, lipids, RNA, and DNA were used. This became a type of simple metabolism and they got energy from the heat of the water. Prokaryotes, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes all originated from primordial soup. Bacteria and Archaea lived close to each other 2 billion years ago. This was a mutually beneficial relationship because bacteria fed on Archaeas waste. And the closer the bacteria lived, the more benefits Archaea got. All complex life on Earth, trees, plants, animals, all of us have evolved from this singlecelled organism, which is possible due to the merger of bacteria and archaea. The bacteria was tolerated because the Archaea did not see any harm in it. This cell is considered to be the ancestor of all multicellular organisms. There is solid evidence that the merger of archaea and bacteria resulted in the bacteria becoming mitochondria and archaea evolved into the rest of the cells. Mitochondria are found only in eukaryotes, and not in prokaryotes. Without mitochondria, it wasnt possible to have any multicellular organism. The first multicellular organism is estimated to have evolved at least 1.5 billion years ago. sformation took at least 2 billion years. The things that were needed for us to be born, are all present in space. So it wont be wrong to say that we are all made of stardust.
