Then he compared these findings with a piece of coal which released the same amount of carbon dioxide and melted the same amount of ice as the body heat of the animal. In this video I explained how our solar system was merely a cloud of dust and rocks, out of which the Sun formed first, and later the Earth. So, the conclusion of this study was that mitochondria and the rest of the cell must have been two different organisms at one point in time. And today, there is solid evidence that the merger of archaea and bacteria resulted in the bacteria becoming mitochondria and archaea evolved into the rest of the cells. And now, if you want to know more about this, about how multicellular organisms evolved to later turn into trees, plants, and humans, I have discussed this in detail in the video on the Theory of Evolution.
